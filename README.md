This is a Virus created using VB SCRIPT and Batch Language.  Actually what is does is so simple. 
It is activated when the user run the malicious exe and after launching the exe. 
The Program calculates autmatically the free Space on all local Drives using VB script and After obtainging it. 
It creates exe files with the same size as the free space counted on all volumes. For example if It obtained Local Disk C with: 20GB free, 
and Local Disk D: 40GB Free. It will create 2 files in differenent Local Disks. One with 20GB in local disk c and The other of 40GB 
in Local Disk D. After creating them It rename them by also changing their extension to .mp4 and 
after changing the extension it hides them.
